        <h2>What is the Boston Massacre?</h2>
        <p>
           "Lobsterbacks!" People rioted in the streets of Boston on the night of March 5, 1770. Rocks and snowballs with pieces of glass and debri were thrown at the British and in return, the british started firing with there musketes. This night would be stained in the history books forever. It would be known as the Boston Massacre.
           </p>
           <p>
           How did it all start? In 1765, taxes were rased on the American Colonists in what was known as the stamp act. This outraged the colonists. The started rioting. The Boston Massacre was one of them.

        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <p>
        It all started on the night of March 5, 1770. A boy named Edward Garrick asked an officert to pay a bill that he had refused to pay to Garrick's Master. Goldfinch (the officer) had settled the account the previous day, and ignored the insult. Garrick started poking the officer in his chest with his finger and soon another man, Private Hugh White left his post on gaurd duty and challenged Garrick. White then struck Garrick on the side of his head with his musket. The boy cried out in pain. Soon, a crowd of angry colonists started building up in front of now many british officers.

        Colonists spit, threw snowballs (with shards of debri in them), and rocks at the british. The british started getting angrier and angrier. Soon, one of the British Soldiers fired. Who? We do not know to this day. Now all of the soldiers started to fire. One of the first people to be killed was Christmas Attuks, who was a man of African and Native American desent. Soon, the crowd moved to the Custom House where the govenor then said that if they stopped, they would have inquiry into the shooting. The crowd stopped. The shooting stopped. Everyone dispersed except for 3 men laying dead on the ground and 2 lay dying on the ground. All of them were American Colonists.

    Many colonists made paintings that looked like the british were evil murders. The painting on the right was made by Paul Revere 3-5 weeks after the incident. But paintings and engravings weren't the only things the people of boston did. Every year after the masasacre, the colonists would hold a party. The 5<sub>th</sub> year, there was supposed to be a big party. The british then planned to mess up the party. They told an officer to go to the party and if they said anything against britan or something unnaceptable, throw an egg at a female there. That would be there signal to basically start another massacre. But luckily, the officer fell down and dropped the egg which broke. No egg was thrown that night.
